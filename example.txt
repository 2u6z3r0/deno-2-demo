Person A: Hey, how's it going?

Person B: Not too bad, just trying to learn something new. You?

Person A: Same here! Been exploring some new programming languages lately.

Person B: Oh, nice! Which ones?

Person A: I started looking into Deno. It's pretty cool so far.

Person B: Deno? Isn't that like Node.js but with some extra features?

Person A: Exactly! It has built-in TypeScript support and better security by default.

Person B: Sounds interesting. Maybe I should give it a try too.

Person A: Definitely! Let me know if you need any tips.
